# Battleship

This program is a battleship clone written by Luke Genova and Amimul Eshan Zoha using Java and JavaFX

- To start the game, two instances of the program must be created, the server(player 1) and the client(player 2).
  - **Therefore, you must run the program twice.**
  - **Also, You must create the server(player 1) process first, or else the game won't start.**
  
- The type of instance created is based on what command line arguments are inputted.
  - **Here is the command line argument structure when starting the program: (server or client) (port number).**
  
- Each instance will create a GUI application that interacts with the users. Once the GUIs are displayed, the game is ready to play.

- Here is how the game works:
  1. Each player must place all of their ships anywhere on their grid before making a move.
  2. Player 1 gets to go first and makes a move.
  3.  Player 2 takes the move and determines the result.
  4.  Player 2 notifies Player 1 of the result.
  5.  Player 2 gets to go next and Vice Versa until one of the player's fleets is destroyed.
